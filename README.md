# README
Beginning to develop an app to track trends in my sleep quality. See if drinking alcohol, consuming less caffeine, stress, exercise patterns can give insights to help me find a way to sleep better more consistently. I have not had good sleep in years and it is has been recommended to create a journal but I always stop. So if there is an easy "daily quiz" to track the data maybe that would help. I plan to make some trend charts once I have some enough data points.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
